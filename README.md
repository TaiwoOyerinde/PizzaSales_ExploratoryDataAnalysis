# PizzaSales_ExploratoryDataAnalysis

_Introduction_
This analysis uses 4 datasets ; orders, order_details, pizzas and pizza_types. They contain simulated data on how pizza orders went in 2015 including; prices, quantity, size, category amongst others. While it is essential that this data is entirely fictional, the analysis techniques are very much real.

_Data Preparation_
Our first task is to ensure our data is ready for analysis. I previewed the datasets using MS Excel Power Query, I confirmed that all the 4 datasets are clean and free of duplicates and missing values.

_SQL Queries for Insights_

SQL is our culinary tool to extract insights from the datasets. We craft SQL queries using the MySQL Workbench that unveils answers to the following peculiarities:

•	Key Metrics:
Number of Pizzas on Menu, Total Orders, Total Pizzas Ordered, Total sales, Average Price of a pizza by size

•	Historical Performance:
Peak Hours, Sales Across Months

•	Pizza Performance:
Best-selling pizza in each category, what are the average sales generated for the top 10 selling pizzas?

•	Customer Preferences:
Worst 5 pizzas by Customer Choices, Top 5 Customer Choices.

It’s akin to creating the perfect pizza recipe, each query designed to uncover a specific flavor of insight.

_Crafting Data Stories_
The insights we unearth are not just numbers, they’re stories waiting to be told. Introducing Power BI, the Visual Masterpiece. Power BI enables us to build interactive dashboards, much like designing a yearly sales report that business managers can navigate with ease. You can explore pizza sales data, filter by month and pizza size and interact with the visualizations in real time.
